    <div class="nba-section">
        <h2>1. Michael Jordan</h2>
        <img src="assets/michael.jpg" alt="michael">
        <p>How much of an explanation do you need here? Of course Michael Jordan is No. 1. This man won three in a row, left to play baseball, then came back to win three in a row again, and then he came back one more time and was one of the oldest players to average 20 PPG and to score 40-plus in a game. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="nba-section">
        <h2>2. LeBron James</h2>
        <img src="assets/lebron.jpg" alt="lebron">
        <p>As someone who has LeBron James as No. 1 on their best NBA players list, this is an easy one to write. When you think of LeBron James, you think of greatness. From the first dribble he took in an NBA game up until now, he’s done nothing but live up to the massive hype that was placed on his shoulders coming out of high school in Akron.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nba-section">
        <h2>3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
        <img src="assets/kareem.jpg" alt="kareem">
        <p>The NBA’s all time leading scorer and inventor of the most lethal shot in Association history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar skyhook-ed his way to 38,387 career points. Maybe, just maybe LeBron James surpasses him in another four or five seasons, but it’s going take a herculean effort on The King’s part to supplant the greatest center ever whose longevity is practically unrivaled.</p>
